# Eel_calculator

Eel calculator, as its name suggests, is a simple calculator made with the python eel framework. It works alongside web technologies, and I made it with the purpose of testing its capabilities for developing quick and modern GUI. For this project I added the functionality of the calculator with Javascript, however the beauty of the eel framework is that it can expose both Javascript and Python functions to both languages. Doing this gives the developer access to various python libraries without the need of learning Tkinter, or another framework.
